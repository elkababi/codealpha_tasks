## Task 2: Emotion Recognition from Speech

### Description
This task involves building a model that can recognize emotions in speech audio. The model classifies spoken sentences into different emotions like happiness, anger, or sadness using deep learning and speech processing techniques.

### Notebook
- [TASK2.ipynb](./TASK2.ipynb)

## Task 3: Handwritten Character Recognition

### Description
This task involves creating a handwritten character recognition system capable of recognizing various handwritten characters or alphabets. The model can be extended to recognize entire words or sentences.

### Notebook
- [TASK3.ipynb](./TASK3.ipynb)

## Task 4: Disease Prediction from Medical Data

### Description
This task involves creating a model to predict the likelihood of a disease based on medical data (e.g., symptoms, patient history). The model uses labeled medical records and applies classification algorithms.

### Notebook
- [TASK4.ipynb](./TASK4.ipynb)

## Installation

To run the projects locally, ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed. You can install the required libraries using the provided `requirements.txt` file in each task directory.
(It is recommended to run the projects in Google Colab for a better experience and to leverage its computational resources.)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Each task is presented as a Jupyter notebook. You can open and run the notebooks using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab. Make sure to follow the instructions provided in each notebook to understand how to run the code, train the models, and test them.
